\rvnote{Is there a mechanism for data redistribution to the collaboration?  Will Unpacked files be available from just Yale, or LLNL and Yale?}

\nbnote{TL - what are plans for Yale storage - raw? or unpacked?}

Raw data is transferred from the DAQ hardware at HFIR to LLNL for archival storage.
A custom software application schedules transfers and supervises each data file's transfer to ensure transfers complete successfully and without data corruption.
Files are first transferred from the PROSPECT gateway computer at HFIR to LLNL's scratch storage, and from there moved to LLNL's HPSS.
The file is checked at each step to ensure errorless transfer, and transfers are logged in a database.

We achieve a transfer speed of approximately 60 MB/s, which significantly outpaces the speed of data taking even in reactor-on conditions.
As a result, in the event of a temporary network outage (one of which has occurred) the data transfer can catch up quickly to the latest data.
This data transfer can be monitored from an internal website, so any collaborator can easily identify if the transfer process is failing.
